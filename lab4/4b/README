My tar file includes the Makefile, the lab4b.c source code file, and this
README file. My Makefile has four components: default, which makes the 
executable file, clean, which removes the executable and the tar file,
check, which has the three smoke test checks, and dist, which makes the 
tar file.

My smoke test has three tests, all which test my program through the exit
codes. My first check tests for a bad argument, which should exit with code 1.
The next case checks for a bad command inputted from stdin, which 
should also exit with code 1. The last check tests for a number of the commands
from stdin, all which should work and exit with code 1.

To do this lab, I used the resources:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/input-buffering-in-compiler-design/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-print-contents-file/
https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/C_Language/file_IO.html

These links helped me to read the commands from stdin and also figure out
how to print to the log file.
