My tar file includes four files:

lab4c_tcp.c: which is the source code for recieving commands and 
sending temperatures to the server.

lab4c_tls.c: which is the source code for sending commands to the 
server via a TLS connection.

Makefile: which makes the executables with the correct library dependencies,
and also makes the tar ball

README: this README file


To complete this project, I had to look at the man pages of SSL_shutdown()
and SSL_get_error(). I also had to look at SSL_read since my method of reading
input byte by byte for command parsing was timing out in lab4c_tls.c
