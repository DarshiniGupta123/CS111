My tar file contains the two screenshots of the segmentation fault and the
value of the pointer, the source code file (lab0.c), a Makefile which creates
the executable, the tar, cleans, and containe the smoke test, and this README.

My smoke test cases check whether my program is working by ensuring the returned exit codes are correct. The command ./lab0 --segfault --dump-core --catch
should return the exit code 139 since dump-core offsets the catch argument and
there should be a segmentation fault. My next smoke test case makes sure the
command ./lab0 with no argument works properly by checking if the exit code
returned is 0, since the simple stdin and stdout should occur. My last smoke
test case checks if the command ./lab0 --segfault --catch functionality
works properly by making sure the code exits with code 4, since the fault
should be caught.
