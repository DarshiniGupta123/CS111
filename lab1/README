For the first part of this lab, I have implemented all of the options,
except profile.  To my knowledge, these options work as they are supposed
to and fulfill the requirements. One limitation in my program is that 
my command option cannot handle a long option in its arguments ("--").

In my tar file, there are three files: the Makefile, the source code, and this
README file. In my Makefile, there is a make check, which has three test cases.
The first checks if simply ./simpsh runs correctly with no arguments and
this shoul return 0. The next smoke test checks for bad arguments and checks
to see if the correct exit status was returned. The last test case checks
if the program exits with a status code of 1, when a --rdonly is passed
with a nonexistant file.
