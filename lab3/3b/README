My tar file contains a README, Makefile, and a lab3b.py
file. My Makefile default option copies my lab3b.py to
an "executable" lab3b and I change the  permissions for both
files so that can be executed. 

I also used the links(http://cs.smith.edu/~nhowe/Teaching/csc262/oldlabs/ext2.html,
http://www.science.unitn.it/~fiorella/guidelinux/tlk/node95.html,
https://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html) in the powerpoint while
doing the project. I also looked at the link
https://realpython.com/python-csv/#parsing-csv-files-with-pythons-built-in-csv-library
to figure out how to parse through files and read lines.
