My tar file contains a README, Makefile, lab3.c, and the ext2_fs.h
file. The header file contains all the structs for the
superblock, groups, inodes, etc.

I also used the links(http://cs.smith.edu/~nhowe/Teaching/csc262/oldlabs/ext2.html,
http://www.science.unitn.it/~fiorella/guidelinux/tlk/node95.html,
https://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html) in the powerpoint extensively while
doing the project.
